# ImageProcessing

Each folder contains codes for processing neuroimages of various modalities.
  - DICOM: processes DICOM and MRI volume files.
  - FreeSurfer_v6: processes T1-weighted images to create ROI masks and calculate neuroataomical metrics.
  - PET: processes PET and FreeSurfer outputs to calculate regional SUV
  - WMH: processes FLAIR to create WMH masks and calculate WMH volumes

For instructions on how to run for imagedatabase management, check README files in each folder.
